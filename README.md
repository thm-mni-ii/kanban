# Kanban

Kanban is being developed as a microservice for the [feedbacksystem](https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/feedbacksystem). It allows students to enhance their soft skills by managing group projects through kanban boards. Lecturers gain insight into the organization and progress of the boards to provide early support and guidance for the groups.
